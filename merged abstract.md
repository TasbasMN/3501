Somatic mutations present in cancer genomes arise due to the influence of various exogenous (external) and endogenous (internal) mutational processes. Each mutational process leaves behind a unique mutational signature, a pattern of mutations, in the genome. The COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) database contains detailed information on the most up-to-date mutational signatures extracted from various cancer types. 

In a recently published study, the topographic features of mutational signatures were extracted. This study demonstrated the distribution of mutational signatures according to DNA processes such as DNA replication (copying), replication timing, transcription (RNA production for gene expression), and genome organization, such as nucleosome occupancy, histone modification occupancy, and CTCF binding occupancy. 

In the proposed project, we anticipate that extending this analysis by investigating the relationships between mutational signatures, microRNAs, and transcription factors could provide some unique and valuable insights. This approach, by exploring the connections between mutational signatures, microRNAs, and transcription factors, could uncover the complex interactions between genetic and epigenetic factors involved in cancer development and progression. 

For this, we will first train machine learning models. We will use artificial intelligence to predict the effects of somatic mutations on transcription and microRNA binding. Using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), we will predict whether the binding of transcription factors and microRNAs to the mutated DNA sequence increases (gain of function) or decreases (loss of function). To achieve this, we will first test our developed machine learning models on the mutation and mutational signature data of 560 breast cancer patients, obtain results for all mutations (aggregated mutations) and each mutational signature, optimize the process, and compile the results as a conference paper. Subsequently, we will apply the developed and optimized process to all cancer types in the PCAWG dataset, both within each cancer type and across cancer types. We will publish the results as a journal article.

There are over 2000 transcription factors and microRNAs in the human genome. Addressing them individually may hinder seeing the big picture; therefore, considering each microRNA within its related microRNA family and each transcription factor within its related transcription family will help us understand which microRNA families and transcription factor families are more affected by the mutations present in the mutational signature. This project will aid in better understanding the underlying mechanisms of somatic mutations in cancer genomes.
